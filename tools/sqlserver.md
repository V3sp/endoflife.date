> [SQLServer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/): Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applicationsâ€”which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network

Each of the products has its own Technical Support Policy, which determine the lifetime and scope of product support.
The 2016 version was the last to which SP appeared. As of 2017, only CU(cumulative update) updates will be available

* SQL Server 2016 Web and Standard editions have an extended lifetime when using the latest Service Pack
